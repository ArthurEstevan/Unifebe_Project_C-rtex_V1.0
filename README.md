## ![](/Icons/icon_conceito.png) About the Project

Project developed in AdonisJs (framework for Node.Js), this project was intended to further fix the knowledge in the database, however, this time the database format was all Typescript. Using our standard Vscode front-end tool.
Finally we will use this project to complement another one I'm developing in Angular (framework for Javascript). In the future you will be able to have access to both projects in a single one.
